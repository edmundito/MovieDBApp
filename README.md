This is a personal project created by [@edmundito](https://github.com/edmundito) to freshen up on React Native and TypeScript. It's an example React Native app that pulls information from [TMDB](https://themoviedb.org/).

## Getting Started

First, setup the .env file:

1. Create `.env.local`
2. Add `TMDB_API_KEY` to `.env.local`

You will need to setup an account on [TMDB](https://themoviedb.org/) in order to get an API key.

Then, run!

```bash
npm start
```

Note: Currently, it's only designed for Android.
